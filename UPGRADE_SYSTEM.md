# Tower Upgrade System - Bloons TD 6 Style

## Overview

We've completely overhauled the tower upgrade system to match the complexity and personality of Bloons TD 6. Each tower now has **3 distinct upgrade paths** with **5 tiers each**, providing meaningful choices that fundamentally change tower behavior.

## Core Mechanics

### Upgrade Path Restrictions (BTD6 Rules)
- **Only 1 path** can reach **Tier 5** (ultimate upgrade)
- **Maximum 2 paths** can reach **Tier 3+** 
- **All paths** can reach **Tier 2**

This creates strategic decisions: Do you specialize in one ultimate path, or spread upgrades across multiple paths for versatility?

### Path Philosophy
Each tower has 3 paths with distinct roles:
- **Path 0**: Usually **damage/offense** focused
- **Path 1**: Usually **utility/support** focused  
- **Path 2**: Usually **special mechanics/unique abilities**

## Tower Upgrade Paths

1. **AI Evolution** - Adaptive intelligence, ending in Transcendent Mind
2. **Modular Systems** - Multi-weapon platform, ending in Reality Arsenal
3. **Sensor Networks** - Omniscient detection, ending in Absolute Awareness

## New Gameplay Mechanics

### Status Effects
- **Burn**: Damage over time, can spread between enemies
- **Slow**: Reduces enemy movement speed
- **Stun**: Completely stops enemies temporarily
- **Critical Hits**: Chance for extra damage
- **Armor Piercing**: Ignores enemy armor

### Advanced Projectiles
- **Homing**: Projectiles seek targets
- **Ricochet**: Bounces between enemies
- **Pierce**: Goes through multiple enemies
- **Multi-shot**: Fires multiple projectiles
- **Splash Damage**: Area effect damage

### Special Abilities
- **Network Effects**: Towers boost each other
- **Global Buffs**: Map-wide effects
- **Reality Manipulation**: Game-breaking tier 5 effects
- **Time Control**: Slowing or accelerating effects
- **Weather Control**: Environmental manipulation

## UI Features

### Branching Interface
- **3 Path Layout**: Visual representation of all paths
- **Tier Bubbles**: Shows progress (1-5) for each path
- **Constraint Indicators**: Shows when upgrades are blocked
- **Hover Tooltips**: Detailed upgrade information

### Visual Feedback
- **Owned Tiers**: Gold gradient bubbles
- **Next Upgrade**: Highlighted with border
- **Locked Tiers**: Grayed out with explanation
- **Upgrade Costs**: Clear pricing information

## Strategic Depth

### Early Game
- Spread upgrades across paths for versatility
- Focus on tier 1-2 upgrades for cost efficiency

### Mid Game  
- Choose specialization paths
- Decide which towers get tier 3+ upgrades

### Late Game
- Commit to tier 5 ultimates
- Create synergistic tower combinations
- Utilize global effects and network bonuses

## Balance Philosophy

Each tier represents a significant power spike:
- **Tier 1-2**: Incremental improvements (affordable)
- **Tier 3**: Unlocks special mechanics (moderate cost)
- **Tier 4**: Major power upgrades (expensive)
- **Tier 5**: Game-changing ultimates (very expensive)

The restriction system prevents overpowered "max everything" scenarios while encouraging meaningful strategic choices about tower specialization.

This system transforms the tower defense experience from simple stat upgrades to meaningful strategic decisions that fundamentally change how towers behave and interact with each other!
